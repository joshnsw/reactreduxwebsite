# reactreduxwebsite


<b>Description:</b>
I am currently doing a course called fullstackopen, and I wanted to use what I learnt about redux and implement it in a project, so I decided to built a mock gym website that has a e-commerce store, with redux handling the state of the store.


## Usage

In the nav bar, there are two pages you can access:

Home page : Its a static website showcasing the gym
Store page : Its a shopping cart page allowing user to add items

## Features

Shopping Cart: Add any item to the shopping cart, and it will calculate the total amount.

## Key challenges/lessons learnt

I used this project in order gain understanding on Redux. The main challenge was to implement redux reducer method , and it took awhile before I was able to successfully gain an understanding of Redux Toolkit and how to configure the store using slicers


## Built With

- [CSS][React] (Frontend)
- [Redux] (Backend)
